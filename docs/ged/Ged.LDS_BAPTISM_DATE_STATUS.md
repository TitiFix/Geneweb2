# Abstract
A code indicating the status of an LDS baptism and confirmation date where:
CHILD=Died before becoming eight years old, baptism not required.
COMPLETED=Completed but the date is not known.
EXCLUDED=Patron excluded this ordinance from being cleared in this submission.
PRE-1970=Ordinance is likely completed, another ordinance for this person was converted
from temple records of work completed before 1970, therefore this ordinance is
assumed to be complete until all records are converted.
STILLBORN=Stillborn, baptism not required.
SUBMITTED=Ordinance was previously submitted.
UNCLEARED=Data for clearing ordinance request was insufficient.
