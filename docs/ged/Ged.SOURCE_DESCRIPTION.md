# SOURCE_DESCRIPTION
## Abstract
A free form text block used to describe the source from which information was obtained.  This text
block is used by those systems which cannot use a pointer to a source record. It must contain a
descriptive title, who created the work, where and when it was created, and where the source data
stored. The developer should encourage users to use an appropriate style for forming this free form
bibliographic reference.  Developers are encouraged to support the SOURCE_RECORD method of
reporting bibliographic reference descriptions.
