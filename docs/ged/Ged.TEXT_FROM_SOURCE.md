# TEXT_FROM_SOURCE
## Abstract
A verbatim copy of any description contained within the source. This indicates notes or text that are
actually contained in the source document, not the submitter's opinion about the source. This should
be, from the evidence point of view, "what the original record keeper said" as opposed to the
researcher's interpretation. The word TEXT, in this case, means from the text which appeared in the
source record including labels.
