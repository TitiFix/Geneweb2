# COUNT_OF_CHILDREN
## Abstract
The known number of children of this individual from all marriages or, if subordinate to a family
record, the reported number of children known to belong to this family, regardless of whether the
associated children are represented in the corresponding structure. This is not necessarily the count of
children listed in a family structure.
