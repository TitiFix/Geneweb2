# Abstract
LDS ordinance dates use only the Gregorian date and most often use the form of day, month, and
year. Only in rare instances is there a partial date. The temple tag and code should always accompany
temple ordinance dates. Sometimes the LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS is used to indicate that an
ordinance date and temple code is not required, such as when BIC is used. (See
LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS definitions )
