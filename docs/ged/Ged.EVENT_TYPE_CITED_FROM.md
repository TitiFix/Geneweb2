# Abstract
A code that indicates the type of event which was responsible for the source entry being recorded. For
example, if the entry was created to record a birth of a child, then the type would be BIRT regardless
of the assertions made from that record, such as the mother's name or mother's birth date. This will
allow a prioritized best view choice and a determination of the certainty associated with the source
used in asserting the cited fact.
