# ROLE_IN_EVENT
## Abstract
Indicates what role this person played in the event that is being cited in this context. For example, if
you cite a child's birth record as the source of the mother's name, the value for this field is "MOTH." If
you describe the groom of a marriage, the role is "HUSB." If the role is something different than one
of the six relationship role tags listed above then enclose the role name within matching parentheses.
