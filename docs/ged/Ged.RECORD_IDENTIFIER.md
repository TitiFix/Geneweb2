# RECORD_IDENTIFIER
## Abstract
An identification number assigned to each record within a specific database. The database to which the
RECORD_IDENTIFIER pertains is indicated by the REGISTERED_RESOURCE_NUMBER which
precedes the colon (:). If the RECORD_IDENTIFIER is not preceded by a colon, it is a reference to a
record within the current GEDCOM transmission.
