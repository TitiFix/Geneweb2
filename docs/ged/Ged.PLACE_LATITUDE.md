# Abstract
The value specifying the latitudinal coordinate of the place name. The latitude coordinate is the
direction North or South from the equator in degrees and fraction of degrees carried out to give the
desired accuracy. For example:  18 degrees, 9 minutes, and 3.4 seconds North would be formatted as
N18.150944.  Minutes and seconds are converted by dividing the minutes value by 60 and the seconds
value by 3600 and adding the results together. This sum becomes the fractional part of the degree’s
value.
