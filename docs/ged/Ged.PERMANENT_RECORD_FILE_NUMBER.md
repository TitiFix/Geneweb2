# PERMANENT_RECORD_FILE_NUMBER 🗑 (Deprecated record)
## Abstract
it is a user identifier for Ancestral File. Ancestral File is obsolete now, so RFN is obsolete too.


## GEDCOM syntax and proprietary extensions

**PERMANENT_RECORD_FILE_NUMBER**:=
<pre>
&lt;<a href=Ged.REGISTERED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER.md>REGISTERED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER</a>&gt;:&lt;<a href=Ged.RECORD_IDENTIFIER.md>RECORD_IDENTIFIER</a>&gt;
</pre>
Used in <a href=Ged.INDIVIDUAL_RECORD.md>INDIVIDUAL_RECORD</a><br />


NOTE: The record number that uniquely identifies this record within a registered network resource. The number
will be usable as a cross-reference pointer. The use of the colon (:) is reserved to indicate the
separation of the "registered resource identifier" (which precedes the colon) and the unique "record
identifier" within that resource (which follows the colon). If the colon is used, implementations that
check pointers should not expect to find a matching cross-reference identifier in the file but
would find it in the indicated database within a network. .
