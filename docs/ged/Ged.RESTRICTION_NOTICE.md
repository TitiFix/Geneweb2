Where:
confidential =This data was marked as confidential by the user.  In some systems data marked as
confidential will be treated differently, for example, there might be an option that
would stop confidential data from appearing on printed reports or would prevent that
information from being exported.
locked=Some records in Ancestral File have been satisfactorily proven by evidence, but
because of source conflicts or incorrect traditions, there are repeated attempts to
change this record. By arrangement, the Ancestral File Custodian can lock a record so
that it cannot be changed without an agreement from the person assigned as the
steward of such a record. The assigned steward is either the submitter listed for the
record or Family History Support when no submitter is listed.
privacy=Indicate that information concerning this record is not present due to rights of or an
approved request for privacy. For example, data from requested downloads of the
Ancestral File may have individuals marked with ‘privacy’ if they are assumed living,
that is they were born within the last 110 years and there isn’t a death date.  In certain
cases family records may also be marked with the RESN tag of privacy if either
individual acting in the role of HUSB or WIFE is assumed living.
