# PLACE_HIERARCHY
## Abstract
This shows the jurisdictional entities that are named in a sequence from the lowest to the highest
jurisdiction. The jurisdictions are separated by commas, and any jurisdiction's name that is missing is
still accounted for by a comma. When a PLAC.FORM structure is included in the HEADER of a
GEDCOM transmission, it implies that all place names follow this jurisdictional format and each
jurisdiction is accounted for by a comma, whether the name is known or not. When the PLAC.FORM
is subordinate to an event, it temporarily overrides the implications made by the PLAC.FORM
structure stated in the HEADER. This usage is not common and, therefore, not encouraged. It should
only be used when a system has over-structured its place-names.
