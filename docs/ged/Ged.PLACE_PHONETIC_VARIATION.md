# PLACE_PHONETIC_VARIATION
## Abstract
The phonetic variation of the place name is written in the same form as  was the place name used in
the superior &lt;<a href=Ged.PLACE_NAME.md>PLACE_NAME</a>&gt; primitive, but phonetically written using the method indicated by the
subordinate &lt;<a href=Ged.PHONETIC_TYPE.md>PHONETIC_TYPE</a>&gt; value, for example if hiragana was used to provide a reading of a a
n ame written in kanji, then the &lt;<a href=Ged.PHONETIC_TYPE.md>PHONETIC_TYPE</a>&gt; value would indicate kana. (See &lt;<a href=Ged.PHONETIC_TYPE.md>PHONETIC_TYPE</a>&gt;)
