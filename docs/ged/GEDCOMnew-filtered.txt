----------------------LINEAGE_LINKED_STRUCTURE
The lineage-linked GEDCOM structure is the main structure of GEDCOM files. A header and a trailer record are required, and they can enclose any number of data records. Tags must be used in the same context as shown in the following form. User defined tags must be used (begin with an under-score, see <NEW_TAG> ).
----------------------
LINEAGE_LINKED_STRUCTURE:=
0 <<HEADER_RECORD>>{1:1}
0 <<SUBMISSION_RECORD>>{0:1}
0 <<SUBMITTER_RECORD>>{1:1}

0 <<MULTIMEDIA_RECORD>>{0:M}
0 <<NOTE_RECORD>>{0:M}
0 <<REPOSITORY_RECORD>>{0:M}
0 <<SOURCE_RECORD>>{0:M}
0 TRLR{1:1}
----------------------HEADER_RECORD
The header structure provides information about the entire transmission. The SOURce system name
identifies which system sent the data. The DESTination system name identifies the intended receiving
system. The reading program must read the GEDC.VERS and the GEDC.FORM values to insure proper readability.
The CHAR tag is mandatory and must be read first to select the appropriate character set.

* NOTE:
Submissions to the Family History Department for Ancestral File submission or for clearing temple ordinances  must use a
DESTination of ANSTFILE or TempleReady, respectively.
----------------------FAM_RECORD
The FAMily record is used to record marriages, common law marriages, and family unions caused by
two people becoming the parents of a child. There can be no more than one HUSB/father and one
WIFE/mother listed in each FAM_RECORD. If, for example, a man participated in more than one
family union, then he would appear in more than one FAM_RECORD. The family record structure
assumes that the HUSB/father is male and WIFE/mother is female.

----------------------
* NOTE :
The preferred order of the CHILdren pointers within a FAMily structure is chronological by birth.
----------------------INDIVIDUAL_RECORD
The individual record is a compilation of facts, known or discovered, about an individual.  Sometimes
these facts are from different sources.  This form allows documentation of the source where each of
the facts were discovered.
The normal lineage links are shown through the use of pointers from the individual to a family
through either the FAMC tag or the FAMS tag.  The FAMC tag provides a pointer to a family where
this person is a child.  The FAMS tag provides a pointer to a family where this person is a spouse or
parent.  The <<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> (see page 31) structure contains a FAMC pointer
which is required to show any child to parent linkage for pedigree navigation.  The
<<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> structure also indicates whether the pedigree link represents a
birth lineage, an adoption lineage, or a sealing lineage.
Linkage between a child and the family they belonged to at the time of an event can also be shown
by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the appropriate event.  For example, a FAMC pointer subordinate
to an adoption event indicates a relationship to family by adoption. Biological parents can be shown
by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the birth event(optional).
Other associations or relationships are represented by the ASSOciation tag.  The person's relation
or association is the person being pointed to. The association or relationship is stated by the value
on the subordinate RELA line.   For example:
0 @I1@ INDI
1 NAME Fred/Jones/
1 ASSO @I2@
2 RELA Godfather

----------------------MULTIMEDIA_RECORD
The BLOB context of the multimedia record was removed in version 5.5.1. A reference to a multimedia
file was added to the record structure.  The file reference occurs one to many times so that multiple files
can be grouped together, each pertaining to the same context. For example, if you wanted to associate a
sound clip and a photo, you would reference each multimedia file and indicate the format using the
FORM tag subordinate to each file reference.

----------------------SUBMISSION_RECORD
The sending system uses a submission record to send instructions and information to the receiving
system. TempleReady processes submission records to determine which temple the cleared records
should be directed to. The submission record is also used for communication between Ancestral File
download requests and TempleReady. Each GEDCOM transmission file should have only one
submission record. Multiple submissions are handled by creating separate GEDCOM transmission
files.

Substructures of the Lineage-Linked Form
----------------------ADDRESS_STRUCTURE
The address structure should be formed as it would appear on a mailing label using the ADDR and
the CONT lines to form the address structure.  The ADDR and CONT lines are required for any
address. The additional subordinate address tags such as STAE and CTRY are provided to be used
by systems that have structured their addresses for indexing and sorting. For backward compatibility
these lines are not to be used in lieu of the required ADDR.and CONT line structure.

----------------------
* NOTE : The usage of IDNO or the FACT tag require that a subordinate TYPE tag be used to define
what kind of identification number or fact classification is being defined.  The TYPE tag can be used
with each of the above tags used in this structure.
----------------------INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_DETAIL
INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_DETAIL:=
n<<EVENT_DETAIL>>{1:1}
nAGE <AGE_AT_EVENT>{0:1}
----------------------INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE
As a general rule, events are things that happen on a specific date. Use the date form ‘BET date
AND date’ to indicate that an event took place at some time between two dates. Resist the
temptation to use a ‘FROM date TO date’ form in an event structure.  If the subject of your
recording occurred over a period of time, then it is probably not an event, but rather an attribute or
fact.
The EVEN tag in this structure is for recording general events that are not shown in the above
<<INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE>>.  The event indicated by this general EVEN tag is
defined by the value of the subordinate TYPE tag. For example, a person that signed a lease for land
dated  October 2, 1837 and a lease for equipment dated November 4, 1837 would be written in
GEDCOM as::
1 EVEN
2 TYPE Land Lease
2 DATE 2 OCT 1837
1 EVEN
2 TYPE Equipment Lease
2 DATE 4 NOV 1837
The TYPE tag can be optionally used to modify the basic understanding of its superior event or
attribute.  For example:
1 GRAD
2 TYPE College
The occurrence of an event is asserted by the presence of either a DATE tag and value or a PLACe
tag and value in the event structure. When neither the date value nor the place value are known then
a Y(es) value on the parent event tag line is required to assert that the event happened.  For example
each of the following GEDCOM structures assert that a death happened:
1 DEAT Y
1 DEAT
2 DATE 2 OCT 1937
1 DEAT
2 PLAC Cove, Cache, Utah
Using this convention, as opposed to the just the presence of the tag, protects GEDCOM processors
which removes (prunes) lines which have neither a value nor any subordinate line.  It also allows a
n ote or source to be attached to an event context without implying that the event occurred.
It is not proper GEDCOM form to use a N(o) value with an event tag to infer that it did not happen.
A convention to handle events which never happened may be defined in the future.

* NOTE : There are special considerations required when using the CONC tag. The usage is to provide a
n ote string that can be concatenated together so that the display program can do its own word
wrapping according to its display window size. The requirement for usage is to either break the text
line in the middle of a word, or if at the end of a word, to add a space to the first of the next CONC
line. Otherwise most operating systems will strip off the trailing space and the space is lost in the
reconstitution of the note.

----------------------PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE
The name value is formed in the manner the name is normally spoken, with the given name and family
n ame (surname) separated by slashes (/). (See <NAME_PERSONAL>, page 54.) Based on the
dynamic nature or unknown compositions of naming conventions, it is difficult to provide more
detailed name piece structure to handle every case. The NPFX, GIVN, NICK, SPFX, SURN, and
NSFX tags are provided optionally for systems that cannot operate effectively with less structured
information.  For current future compatibility, all systems must construct their names based on the
<NAME_PERSONAL> structure. Those using the optional name pieces should assume that few
systems will process them, and most will not provide the name pieces.
A <NAME_TYPE> is used to specify the particular variation that this name is.  For example; if the
n ame type is subordinate to the <NAME_PERSONAL> it could indicate that this name is a name
taken at immigration or that it could be an ‘also known as’ name (see  page 56.)
Future GEDCOM releases (6.0 or later) will likely apply a very different strategy to resolve this
problem, possibly using a sophisticated parser and a name-knowledge database.

----------------------SOURCE_CITATION
The data provided in the <<SOURCE_CITATION>> structure is source-related information specific
to the data being cited. Systems that do not use a (SOURCE_RECORD)  must use the non-preferred second SOURce citation structure option.  When systems that support the zero level source record format encounters a source citation that does not
contain pointers to source records, then that system needs to create a SOURCE_RECORD format
and store the source description information found in the non-structured source citation in the title
area for the new source record.
The information intended to be placed in the citation structure includes:
!The pointer to the SOURCE_RECORD, which contains a more general description of the source
used for the fact being cited.
!Information, such as a page number, to help the user find the cited data within the referenced
source. This is stored in the “.SOUR.PAGE” tag context.
!Actual text from the source that was used in making assertions, for example a date phrase as
actually recorded in the source, or significant notes written by the recorder, or an applicable
sentence from a letter. This is stored in the “.SOUR.DATA.TEXT” tag context.
!Data that allows an assessment of the relative value of one source over another for making the
recorded assertions (primary or secondary source, etc.).  Data needed for this assessment is data
that would help determine  how much time from the date of the asserted fact and when the source
was actually recorded, what type of event was cited, and what type of role did this person have in
the cited source.
-Date when the entry was recorded in source document is stored in the
".SOUR.DATA.DATE" tag context.
-The type of event that initiated the recording is stored in the “SOUR.EVEN” tag context. The
value used is the event code taken from the table of choices shown in the EVENT_TYPE_CITED_FROM primitive
-The role of this person in the event is stored in the ".SOUR.EVEN.ROLE" context.

----------------------SOURCE_REPOSITORY_CITATION
This structure is used within a source record to point to a name and address record of the holder of the
source document.  Formal and informal repository name and addresses are stored in the
REPOSITORY_RECORD.  Informal repositories include owner's of an unpublished work or of a rare
published source, or a keeper of personal collections. An example would be the owner of a family Bible
containing unpublished family genealogical entries. More formal repositories, such as the Family History
Library, should show a call number of the source at that repository. The call number of that source
should be recorded using a subordinate CALN tag.  Systems which do not use repository name and
address record, should describe where the information cited is stored in the <<NOTE_STRUCTURE>>
of the REPOsitory source citation structure.

Primitive Elements of the Lineage-Linked Form
The field sizes show the minimum recommended field length within a database that is constrained to fixed
length fields. The field sizes are in addition to the GEDCOM level and tag overhead. GEDCOM lines are
limited to 255 characters. However, the CONCatenation or CONTinuation tags can be used to expand a
field beyond this limit. CONT line implies that a new line should appear to preserve formatting.  CONC
implies concatenation to the previous line without a new line.  This is used so that a text note or
description can be processed (word wrapped) in a text window without fixed carriage returns.  The
CONT and CONC tags are being used to extend specified textual values.

indicates that the event state (perhaps a single day) existed somewhere between 1904 and
1915 inclusive.
The date range differs from the date period in that the date range is an estimate that an event happened
on a single date somewhere in the date range specified.
The following are equivalent and interchangeable:

----------------------
DATE_RANGE:={Size=8:35}
[ BEF <DATE> | AFT <DATE> | BET <DATE> AND <DATE> ]
----------------------DATE_VALUE
The DATE_VALUE represents the date of an activity, attribute, or event where:
INT=Interpreted from knowledge about the associated date phrase included in parentheses.
An acceptable alternative to the date phrase choice is to use one of the other choices such as
<DATE_APPROXIMATED> choice as the DATE line value and then include the date phrase value
as a NOTE value subordinate to the DATE line tag.
The date value can take on the date form of just a date, an approximated date, between a date and
another date, and from one date to another date.  The preferred form of showing date imprecision, is
to show, for example, MAY 1890 rather than ABT 12 MAY 1890.  This is because limits have not
been assigned to the precision of the prefixes such as ABT or EST.

Text describing a particular event pertaining to the individual or family. This event value is usually
assigned to the EVEN tag.  The classification as to the difference between this specific event and other
occurrences of the EVENt tag is indicated by the use of a subordinate TYPE tag selected from the
EVENT_DETAIL structure.  For example;
1 EVEN Appointed Zoning Committee Chairperson

----------------------
EVENT_DESCRIPTOR:={Size=1:90}
----------------------EVENT_OR_FACT_CLASSIFICATION
A descriptive word or phrase used to further classify the parent event or attribute tag. This should be
used whenever either of  the generic EVEN or FACT tags are used. The value of this primative is
responsible for classifying the generic event or fact being cited. For example, if the attribute being
defined was one of the persons skills, such as woodworking, the FACT tag would have the value of
`Woodworking', followed by a subordinate TYPE tag with the value `Skills.'
1 FACT Woodworking
2 TYPE Skills
This groups the fact into a generic skills attribute, and in particular this entry records the fact that this
individual possessed the skill of woodworking. Using the subordinate TYPE tag classification method
with any of the other defined event tags provides a further classification of the parent tag but does not
change the basic meaning of the parent tag. For example, a MARR tag could be subordinated with a
TYPE tag with an EVENT_DESCRIPTOR value of `Common Law.'
1 MARR
2 TYPE Common Law
This classifies the entry as a common law marriage but the event is still a marriage event. Other
descriptor values might include, for example,`stillborn' as a qualifier to BIRTh or `Tribal Custom' as a
qualifier to MARRiage.
----------------------
EVENT_OR_FACT_CLASSIFICATION:={Size=1:90}
----------------------EVENT_TYPE_CITED_FROM
A code that indicates the type of event which was responsible for the source entry being recorded. For
example, if the entry was created to record a birth of a child, then the type would be BIRT regardless
of the assertions made from that record, such as the mother's name or mother's birth date. This will
allow a prioritized best view choice and a determination of the certainty associated with the source
used in asserting the cited fact.

----------------------NAME_PERSONAL
The surname of an individual, if known, is enclosed between two slash (/) characters. The order of the
n ame parts should be the order that the person would, by custom of their culture, have used when
®
giving it to a recorder. Early versions of Personal Ancestral File  and other products did not use the
trailing slash when the surname was the last element of the name. If part of name is illegible, that part
is indicated by an ellipsis (...). Capitalize the name of a person or place in the conventional
manner—capitalize the first letter of each part and lowercase the other letters, unless conventional
usage is otherwise. For example: McMurray.
Examples:
William Lee (given name only or surname not known)
/Parry/ (surname only)
William Lee /Parry/

The record number that uniquely identifies this record within a registered network resource. The
n umber will be usable as a cross-reference pointer. The use of the colon (:) is reserved to indicate the
separation of the "registered resource identifier" (which precedes the colon) and the unique "record
identifier" within that resource (which follows the colon). If the colon is used, implementations that
check pointers should not expect to find a matching cross-reference identifier in the transmission but
would find it in the indicated database within a network. Making resource files available to a public

----------------------PLACE_HIERARCHY
This shows the jurisdictional entities that are named in a sequence from the lowest to the highest
jurisdiction. The jurisdictions are separated by commas, and any jurisdiction's name that is missing is
still accounted for by a comma. When a PLAC.FORM structure is included in the HEADER of a
GEDCOM transmission, it implies that all place names follow this jurisdictional format and each
jurisdiction is accounted for by a comma, whether the name is known or not. When the PLAC.FORM
is subordinate to an event, it temporarily overrides the implications made by the PLAC.FORM
structure stated in the HEADER. This usage is not common and, therefore, not encouraged. It should
only be used when a system has over-structured its place-names.

N18.150944.  Minutes and seconds are converted by dividing the minutes value by 60 and the seconds
value by 3600 and adding the results together. This sum becomes the fractional part of the degree’s
value.

confidential will be treated differently, for example, there might be an option that
would stop confidential data from appearing on printed reports or would prevent that
information from being exported.
locked=Some records in Ancestral File have been satisfactorily proven by evidence, but
because of source conflicts or incorrect traditions, there are repeated attempts to
change this record. By arrangement, the Ancestral File Custodian can lock a record so
that it cannot be changed without an agreement from the person assigned as the
steward of such a record. The assigned steward is either the submitter listed for the
record or Family History Support when no submitter is listed.
privacy=Indicate that information concerning this record is not present due to rights of or an
approved request for privacy. For example, data from requested downloads of the
Ancestral File may have individuals marked with ‘privacy’ if they are assumed living,

Either a pointer or an unique cross-reference identifier. If this element appears before the tag in a
GEDCOM line, then it is a cross-reference identifier. If it appears after the tag in a GEDCOM line,
then it is a pointer. The method of delimiting a pointer or cross-reference identifier is to enclose the
pointer or cross-reference identifier within at signs (@), for example, @I123@. A XREF may not
begin with a number sign (#). This is to avoid confusion with an escape sequence prefix (@#). The use
of a colon (:) in the XREF is reserved for creating future network cross-references and the use of an
exclamation (!) is reserved for intra-record pointers. Uniqueness of the cross-reference identifier is
