# Abstract
The romanized variation of the name is written in the same form prescribed for the name used in the
superior &lt;<a href=Ged.NAME_PERSONAL.md>NAME_PERSONAL</a>&gt; context. The method used to romanize the name is indicated by the
line_value of the subordinate &lt;<a href=Ged.ROMANIZED_TYPE.md>ROMANIZED_TYPE</a>&gt;, for example if romaji was used to provide a
reading of a name written in kanji, then the ROMANIZED_TYPE subordinate to the ROMN tag
would indicate romaji. See page 61.
